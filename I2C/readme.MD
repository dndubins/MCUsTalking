These two sketches, I2Cmaster.ino and I2Cslave.ino, set up two Unos to send information to each other bi-directionally using an I2C bus. The slave sketch can be used for multiple slaves as long as the I2C address is changed.
These sketches were adapted from the DroneBot Workshop YouTube video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PnG4fO5_vU4&t=326s&ab_channel=DroneBotWorkshop<p>
If you are interested in learning more about I2C, this is an excellent intro video to get you going!
