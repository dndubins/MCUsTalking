# Connecting Two MCUs via Bluetooth
These two sketches connect two Unos together, to send information to each other using an HC-05 (as master) and HC-06 (as slave).<p>

The sketches BTmaster.ino and BTslave.ino allow for bi-directional communication, with some simple error checking.<br>

These sketches were inspired from https://www.martyncurrey.com/connecting-2-arduinos-by-bluetooth-using-a-hc-05-and-a-hc-06-pair-bind-and-link/<p>
